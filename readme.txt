Bike design
    - MOI was too high (height of carriage)
    - problem in using arm and placing it as well
    - 
    angle max for toppling

    - high COM 
        - better maneuver 
        - low stability
        -(but dont know how much)
        - realised low COM required 

team work
    - tried to make dependent tasks as independent as possible
    - we use to research and think a lot before starting the task
